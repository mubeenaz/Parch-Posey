# Parch-Posey

## Introduction 

In this project, I work as a Data Analyst for Parch & Posey, a paper company with 50 sales representatives spread across 4 regions in the United States. They sell 3 types of papers: standard, gloss, and poster. It's clients consist of 351 Fortune 500 companies who purchase paper for varying needs throughout the year.  

Using SQL, I was able to answer several business questions which aided Parch & Posey in better understanding its company data and provided insight into areas of improvement that will facilitate future growth. Some of these questions include which marketing channels were used most and least frequently to attract clients, dividing all customers into 3 levels (top, middle, low) based on the total sales of all their orders, and months with most/least number of orders. 

## Repository Contents 

The business questions asked along with the SQL written to answer them is divided into two files which can be found in the `Queries/` folder. 

The code for creation of tables within the Parch & Posey database and insertion of data into those tables is contained within the `parch_posey_data.sql` script.
